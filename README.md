# 🎮 Clicky Crates

**Clicky Crates** is a fast-paced arcade game inspired by *Fruit Ninja*, built as **Prototype 5** from Unity’s Junior Programmer Pathway.

The player must click on falling crates before they reach the bottom of the screen while avoiding skulls that reduce the score. As the game progresses, the challenge increases through multiple difficulty levels.
