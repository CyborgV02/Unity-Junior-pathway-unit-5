Unity Junior Programmer Pathway – Challenge 5 (Bug Fixing Project)

This project is a prebuilt Unity game from the Unity Junior Programmer Pathway.
The objective of this challenge was to identify and fix bugs in an existing codebase, focusing on logic errors, UI behavior, and gameplay correctness.

The game uses manual difficulty selection rather than dynamic difficulty scaling.

Corrected difficulty button behavior

Fixed Game Over trigger when clicking bad food

Resolved UI update issues (TextMeshPro)

Fixed prefab references and list assignments

🎮 Gameplay Overview
